# Getting Started with I2C Communication

Welcome to my first post about I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication! This category will cover about the experience that I learnt while doing I2C communication

## What is I2C?

I2C is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors).

## Key Features

- **Two-wire interface**: SDA (Serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line)
- **Multi-master capability**: Multiple master devices can control the bus
- **Address-based communication**: Each slave device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address
- **Built-in arbitration**: Prevents conflicts when multiple masters try to control the bus

## Coming Up

In this I2C category, I'll be covering:
- Basic I2C protocol overview
- Hardware implementation
- Software libraries and examples
- Common troubleshooting tips
- Advanced I2C topics

Stay tuned for more I2C content!
